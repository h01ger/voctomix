What needs to be done before we can upload this to sid:
 * This lintian warnings need to be properly fixed:
   E: voctomix-gui: python-script-but-no-python-dep usr/share/voctomix/voctogui/voctogui.py
   E: voctomix-core: python-script-but-no-python-dep usr/share/voctomix/voctocore/voctocore.py
 * Improve long package descriptions.
 * h01ger cannot maintain this alone. Please speak up if you want to help!
   h01ger is happy to sponsor uploads though.

What could be done:
 * automate creating the orig.tar.xz though this should be coordinated with
   upstream. Currently these commands can be used to create it:
   VERSION=0.3
   git archive --format tar.gz --prefix=voctomix-$VERSION.orig/ -o ../voctomix_0.3.orig.tar.gz origin/master
   gunzip ../voctomix_$VERSION.orig.tar.gz
   xz ../voctomix_$VERSION.orig.tar
