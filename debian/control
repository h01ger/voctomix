Description: Full-HD Software Live-Video-Mixer
 The Voctomix Project by the C3Voc (the Chaos Communication Congress' Video
 Operation Crew) is their software implementation of a Live-Video-Mixer.
 .
 It is written in Python using GStreamer and consists of three parts:
  - Voctocore, the videomixer core-process that does the actual video- and
    audio crunching
  - Voctogui, a GUI implementation in GTK controlling the core's functionality
    and giving visual feedback of the mixed video
  - Voctotools (not yet implemented), a collection of tools and examples on how
    to talk to the core-process, feeding and receiving video-streams
 .
 This package depends on all the components and also contains the
 documentation.
