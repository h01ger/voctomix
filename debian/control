Description: Full-HD Software Live-Video-Mixer
 The Voctomix Project by the C3Voc (the Chaos Communication Congress' Video
 Operation Crew) is their software implementation of a Live-Video-Mixer.
 .
 It is written in Python using GStreamer and consists of three parts:
  - Voctocore, the videomixer core-process that does the actual video- and
    audio crunching.
  - Voctogui, a GUI implementation in GTK+ controlling the core's functionality
    and giving visual feedback of the mixed video.
  - Voctomix Example Scripts, a collection of tools and examples for talking
    to the core-process, feeding and receiving video-streams and controlling
    operations from scripts or command-line.
 .
 This package depends on all the components and also contains the
 documentation and example scripts.
